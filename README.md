# Lab-2-Godot

This is my submission for the Lab 2 Assignment, Veggie Ninja. It is a version of Fruit Ninja that uses all 2D elements and focuses on vegetables instead of fruits. There are 3 levels based on difficulty, which are scaled based on time limit, spawn rate of veggies, and spawn rate/max limit of bombs that can appear. There are a total of 15 veggies, divided into 3 groups, each one having a unique spawn rate or rarity, consistent for all levels. I also added a high score feature, which records the highest score you got for each level and displays it on the level select screen. Each level has its own music, with sword slash and bomb explosion sound effects/animations as well. The controls are pretty simple, you just click your mouse on as many veggies as you can, and try to avoid the bombs. If you click 3 bombs, you lose.
